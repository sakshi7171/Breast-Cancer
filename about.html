        <h1>Breast Cancer Treatment</h1>
        <h3>Because breast cancer accounts for 22.9% of all cancers in women, the treatment options are innumerable. While it may seem overwhelming, it signifies major progress in the ability to treat this disease. Your breast cancer doctor will go over these options with you, compiling a treatment plan that is effective. The breast cancer treatment plan is determined by whether it is invasive or non-invasive. It may also be referred to as local or systemic cancer. Local cancers are in one location and can be surgically removed while systemic cancers have spread to other parts of the body and need a combined therapy approach to eliminate the migrating cancer cells</h3>
